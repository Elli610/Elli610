# Bonjour. 👋

**French engineer. I will find the flaw in your system before I find something nice to say about it.**
**Then I will fix it anyway, faster than expected, with unnecessary elegance.**

`rust` · `low-latency` · `blockchain` · `cryptography` · `no hair, no drag`

### About

By day, I build high-performance financial infrastructure for a blockchain world that refuses to wait more than a microsecond.
By night, I do the same thing. Sleep is a deprecated feature.

I'm 24 and completely bald — which I consider a performance optimization. Less aerodynamic drag. Faster thinking. No time wasted on haircuts. The correlation with my obsession over microsecond latency is probably not a coincidence.

I also teach Rust and Web3. Limited slides, no theory-first — just code, benchmarks, and real protocols. My students build order books and smart contracts from scratch before they're allowed to have opinions about them.

I'm far from the best in any discipline. But I'm trying every day.

### What I'm Working On

🔐 **[ypass](https://github.com/Elli610/ypass)** — Deterministic password generator leveraging YubiKey hardware security. Because "password123" is not infrastructure.

⛏️ **[P2Pool-frontend](https://github.com/Elli610/P2Pool-frontend)** — Frontend for decentralized Monero mining. Trustless by design, not by accident.

🔧 **[dockerized-claude-code](https://github.com/Elli610/dockerized-claude-code)** — Containerized agentic coding environment. Built in Rust, obviously.

---

### Teaching

I design hands-on workshops where people build real systems — not toy examples, real ones:

🦀 **[orderbook-td](https://github.com/Elli610/orderbook-td)** — Implement a high-performance limit order book in Rust. Focus on low-latency data structures. Benchmarks are the grade.

⛓️ **[Blockchain-101](https://github.com/Elli610/Blockchain-101)** — Solidity, node setup, DeFi protocols, and fundamentals. A workshop series that keeps growing because the industry keeps moving.

---

### Stack 

Rust for everything. Solidity when the client insists. TypeScript when I've accepted my fate. 
Low-latency systems, decentralized protocols, and a personal vendetta against anyone who thinks a croissant can be made outside of France. The rest is just tooling — it changes, the obsession doesn't.

*Decentralization is not a trend. Privacy is not a feature. Latency is not a constraint — it's a challenge.*

*If you're building something that matters in Web3, reach out. Or don't. The blockchain doesn't care either way. But I do. A little.*

*🇫🇷 One `unsafe {}` block at a time.*
