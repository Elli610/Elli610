### 🦀 About Me

I'm a fintech engineer and **educator** based in France, passionate about building **high-performance systems in Rust** and pushing the boundaries of **blockchain technology**. I thrive at the intersection of traditional finance infrastructure and decentralized protocols — where every microsecond counts and trustlessness is the default.

I also **teach Rust and Web3** — designing hands-on workshops where students build real systems like high-performance order books and smart contracts from scratch. When I'm not in the classroom or optimizing hot paths, you'll find me hacking arround the world, contributing to Bitcoin mining infrastructure, or building security-first tooling.

### ⚡ What I'm Working On

🔐 **[ypass](https://github.com/Elli610/ypass)** — Deterministic password generator leveraging YubiKey hardware security

⛏️ **[P2Pool-frontend](https://github.com/Elli610/P2Pool-frontend)** — Frontend for decentralized Monero mining pool

🔧 **[dockerized-claude-code](https://github.com/Elli610/dockerized-claude-code)** — Simple containerized agentic coding environment, built in Rust

### 🎓 Teaching & Workshops

I design and deliver hands-on technical workshops focused on building real systems from scratch:

🦀 **[orderbook-td](https://github.com/Elli610/orderbook-td)** — Students implement a highly efficient limit order book in Rust, focusing on low-latency data structures and performance optimization

⛓️ **[Blockchain-101](https://github.com/Elli610/Blockchain-101)** — A growing collection of workshops covering Solidity smart contracts, node setup & operation, DeFi protocols, and blockchain fundamentals

My teaching philosophy: **learn by building**. No slides, no theory-first — just code, benchmarks, and real protocols.
